# **use**able

`useable`, coordinated by [Accessible Community](https://www.accessiblecommunity.org), associates people with disabilities' requirements for use with broader functional categories and known diabilities. This categorization crosses digial and physical spaces as well as accommodations in a way that previous categorizations have not. This type of mapping is needed to help build tools and resources to help the entire disability community.

The `useable` categorization is based around previous work provided by
* [Functional Performance Criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#302-functional-performance-criteria) listed in the United States Section 508 Standards for Digital Accessibility
* [Functional Performance Statements](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.01.01_60/en_301549v030101p.pdf) listed in the European EN 301-549 Standards for Digital Accessibility
* The [disability and accommodation taxonomy](https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm) provided by the Job Accommodation Network
* [Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/) provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

We welcome comments and feedback to encourage the establishment of a worldwide mapping to help build tools and solutions for people with disabilities.

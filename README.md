# **use**able v0.0.1-5-gf29d752

`useable`, coordinated by [Accessible Community](https://www.accessiblecommunity.org), associates people with disabilities' requirements for use with broader functional categories and known diabilities. This taxonomy crosses digital and physical spaces as well as accommodations in a way that previous categorizations have not. This type of mapping is needed to help build tools and resources to help the entire disability community.

The taxonomy is available for view at [https://accessiblecommunity.github.io/useable](https://accessiblecommunity.github.io/useable).

The `useable` taxonomy is based around previous work in the fields of accessibility and accommodations:
* [Functional Performance Criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#302-functional-performance-criteria) provided by the United States Section 508 Standards for Digital Accessibility.
* [Functional Performance Statements](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.01.01_60/en_301549v030101p.pdf) provided by the European EN 301-549 Standards for Digital Accessibility.
* [The Listing of Impairments for adults](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm) provided by the United States' Social Security Administration (SSA).
* [Guide to the List of Recognised Disabilities](https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/disability-and-carers/benefits-payments/carer-allowance/guide-to-the-list-of-recognised-disabilities) provided by the Australian Government Department of Social Services.

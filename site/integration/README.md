Useable Integraton
==================

This is an [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference) that takes the raw CSVs in the `data` directory and converts them into the the files that our site expects.

* `content` defines the various content files that Astro expects.
* `tarball` generates the compressed file for downloading in the `public` directory.
